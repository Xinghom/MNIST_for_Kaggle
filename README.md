# MNIST Recognizer with CNN for high accuracy

MNIST is a database containing images of handwritten digits, with each image labeled by integer. It is used to benchmark the performance of machine learning algorithms. Deep learning performs quite well on MNIST, achieving more than 99.7% accuracy.

## Purpose

- First try for Kaggle submission
- Training on Jupyter Notebook 
- Keras front-end experience (more friendly than TF)
- Review CNN for classification
- preparing for Video Segmentation

## Network Intro

- VGG-like Network with BN.
- Training with Dropout
- AdamGrad optimizer
